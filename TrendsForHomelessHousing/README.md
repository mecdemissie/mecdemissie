### Trends of Housing for Homeless

This project was used to tell a story of the data received from the Housing Inventory Count. The purpose was to see the demographics of the beds occupied in housing organizations located in the D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area. Using the demogrpahics, the visualizations would suggest where people should go based on the trends.
