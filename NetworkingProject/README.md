### Company Network Design

This project was used to create a mock network design for an exisitng company based on location of offices and number of employees. LAN and WAN topoliges were put into thought as well as what devices are  in the network and how they would communicate with each other using subnetting. Nodes were also configured with security protocols such as firewalls and demilitarized zones.
