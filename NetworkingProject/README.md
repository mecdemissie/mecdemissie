### Company Network Design

This project was used to create a mock network design for an existing company based on the location of offices and the number of employees. LAN and WAN topologies were put into thought as well as what devices are in the network and how they would communicate with each other using subnetting. Nodes were also configured with security protocols such as firewalls and demilitarized zones.
