### Cryptography in Java

This project was used to create a simple cryptography program using Java code. Two types of cipher used  was the Caesar cipher. 
The Caesar cipher program works by asking the text of what you want to encrypt. Then, it will ask the fixed number of what you want to shift the alphabet by.
The program then displays the cipher and deciphers to show the message.
