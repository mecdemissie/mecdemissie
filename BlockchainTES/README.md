### Blockchain Based Transactivce Energy Systems

This programming project was used in a larger project to create a blockchain for Transactive Energy Systems (TES) that will help better manage the movement of energy systems. Our group wanted the application to be used in the real world, so we came up with a solution to create a secure communication between the mock energy company and the end-user, Python was used to create the source code.
